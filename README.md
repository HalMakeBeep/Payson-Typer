# Payson Typer (TypingClub Helper)

This tool can type a TypingClub lesson for you automatically.

## Install the script

1. Open the [Bookmarklet Installer](https://halmakebeep.github.io/Payson-Typer/BOOKMARKLET_INSTALL.html).
2. Drag the **Payson Typer** button onto your bookmarks bar.

## How to use it (simple steps)

1. Open a TypingClub lesson.
2. Run the bookmarklet from `paysontyper.bookmarklet.js`.
3. In the panel, choose:
   - `Typing Speed (WPM)`
   - `Accuracy`
   - `Rhythm Variance`
4. Click **Start Typing**.
5. Click **Stop** any time if needed.

## What each setting means

- `Typing Speed`: How fast it types.
- `Accuracy`: Lower values pre-plan more mistyped character replacements.
- `Rhythm Variance`: Higher values make timing less uniform.

## Notes

- If the panel is in the way, drag it by its header.
- Press **Right Shift** to quickly hide/show it.
- If a lesson behaves oddly, stop and start again on the same line.
- Does not support some testing types on the site (the bubble shit or whatever its called)
